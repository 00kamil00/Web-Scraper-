This project is a simple web scraper written in Python that collects basic information about countries from scrapethissite.com 🌎. 
It sends an HTTP request, processes the HTML using BeautifulSoup, and extracts data such as country name, capital city, population, and area. 
The collected information is stored as a list of dictionaries, converted into a pandas DataFrame, and finally exported to a CSV file (countries.csv) for further analysis or integration into other projects 📈. 
The project demonstrates how to build practical web scrapers, parse website content, and transform raw HTML data into clean, structured datasets ready for use.
